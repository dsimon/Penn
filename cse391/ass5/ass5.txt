1) 	No, it does not matter whether I define sockedness as a goal,
	it will occur since the only way to achive shoedness is by
	first achieving sockedness.  It may make a difference to the
	process that develops the plan, but only in the order in which 
	it attempts to find a path.  By stating sockedness as a goal,
	one keeps the planner from having to find a path to shoedness.

3)	In the case where socked feet is not a goal, the roach will be
	killed by projectile.  In the case of shoed feet as a goal,
	the roach will be killed by stomping.
