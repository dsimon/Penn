--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.1,para.2

> come in several flavours

	Same as always, British spelling!

p.5, para.-3

> We have sen that the declarative approach

	"We have seen that"

p.9, para.-3

> extending the basic Prolog model in different the.

	This makes no sense!!  What did you mean?? :-)

All over

> behaviour

	British spelling of behavior.

p.19, para.-1

> One problem with this approach is that it is easy to carried away

	perhaps "to get carried away"

p.19, para.1

> Perhaps Dog and Chien are two nodes

	Do you mean "chicken" or is Chien the name of some breed?



-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.1, para.-2

> that these nodes are organized in a taxonomic structure, and that
> binary relations joing those nodes.

	replace "those nodes" with "these nodes" or "the nodes"

p.7, para.-4

> Prolog inferences unsound, but actual errors happen very seldom,

	seldom is either an adverb (not often, infrequently) or
	an adjective (infrequent, rare).  The American Heritage
	Electronic Dictionary says the adjective form is "archaic."

p.13, para.1

> The SAM (...) program was the first, proving a lemma in lattice
> theory

	Was this a new lemma, a tough one to solve, or what?  I'd be
	interested in a little more detail (the history, as it were).

p.17, footnote

> Nixon was a Quaker (and hence a pacifist)

	Is this true?  I went to a Quaker school for 13 years and
	never heard that Nixon was a Quaker!  I'd check this out, 
	because they were pretty proud of all the historical Quakers,
	and they would have mentioned that (unless Nixon is not
	someone to be proud of ;-).
