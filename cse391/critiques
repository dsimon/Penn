--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.1, byline:

> Search More Directly to the Goal.

	Should probably be something like 'toward' instead of 'to'

p.4, para.4

> The behaviour of A* search 

	British spelling of behaviour (I looked it up in noah)

p.4, para.-2

> is straightforwrd to

	You mean "is straight forward to"

p.5, para.1

> more narrowly focussed around

	focussed is the less common spelling of focused

p.5, para.-1

> it must eventually expand reach a goal state

	perhaps you meant "expand to reach a goal state" or just
	"reach a goal state"

p.6, para.-2

> will occur uness the

	"unless"

p.8, para.4

> node in question. because the

	I don't know what you mean here!

p.8, para.-4

> say exactly whatthe contribution

	put a space between "what" and "the"

p.9, para.3

> three times alongany

	put a space between "along" and "any"


-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.5, para.-3

> (there must be some such node, unless the path has been completely
> expanded in which case the algorithm would have returned G)

	Run on sentence.  The "in which case" should be made into
	another sentence or worded differently (notes in parentheses 
	do not have to be single sentences.  Take this one, for 
	instance :-)

p.6, para.2

	I like the Zeno's paradox stuff, but you may wish to explain
	why from W to S, h should have been 3 (I understand, but many
	won't).
	
p.9, para.-3

> The unresolved question is whether SMA* is optimally efficient among
> all algorithms given the same heuristic information and the same
> memory allocation.

   	Call me dumb, but I'm confused as what the question is
	actually about.  I guess optimally efficient doesn't explain 
	enough here for me.

p.12, para.-2

> but in most problems the operators are not predictable, as discussed

	Should be "the effects of the operators are not"...

Chapter 6 (second version, dated 9/15/93)
Student: Derron Simon

--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.10, para.7

> Ontological commitments have to with what is assumed to exist.

	I think you mean "have to do with"

-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.2, para.-3

> Point 1  It is also possible ...

	Since a point should stand alone, you want to replace it with 
	"It is possible" .

p.6, para.4

> ... Pluto will shortly arrive in Bucharest ...

	I didn't follow that logic, how would our agent infer that?

------------------------------- FIGURES --------------------------------------

p.7.

>The Language of Thought

	Nice side information.  Pretty interesting!

p.14, figure 6.10

	What is the big agent on the right doing?  Is that something
	in it's hands?

------------------------------ OVERALL ---------------------------------------

I really liked this chapter.  It was much easier to read than the
previous chapters.  It seems as if a lot of effore has already been
put into debugging this chapter - as shown by the scarcity of problems
I found with it.

Chapter 8
Student: Derron Simon



--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.8, para.4

> estimating labour costs

	British spelling of labor.

-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.1, para.2

> and writes down a formal description

	How about just "writes a formal description"?

p.1, para.2

> we will use examples that should already be fairly familiar

	How about "we will use examples that would already be familiar
	to a computer engineer" or something along those lines.  It 
	seems a little presumptuous to assume everyone knows TTL design.

p.1, para.-3

> build on these properties of the language it is written in

	Awkward.
 
p.7, para-3

	You mention Wumpus World, you might want to reference the
	reader to chapter 6.

p.8, para.1

> taxonomy to help the agent predict behaviour from scanty clues.

	"scanty clues" is quite an unusual phrase, it seems to carry 
	an odd connotation.

p.8, para.6

> for fruits or monetary instruments

	just being nit-picky, but I'd use monetary units... :>

p.12, para.3

> Generally speaking, instead of saying, as we did in situation
> calculus, that a given fact is true in a particular situation, we
> we'll say that a given event occured in a particular interval.

	Awkward sentence (and as you can see from the above
	formatting, many repeated words!)

p.16, para.2

> For our purposes a fluent is something that flows or changes across
> situations.  

	You may want more of a definition here.

------------------------------- FIGURES --------------------------------------

p.2 - Knowledge Engineering vs. Programming

	The analogy between "implementing the proof theory" and
	"choosing or writing a compiler" is a little weak.

Chapter 10
Student: Derron Simon



--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.1,para.2

> come in several flavours

	Same as always, British spelling!

p.5, para.-3

> We have sen that the declarative approach

	"We have seen that"

p.9, para.-3

> extending the basic Prolog model in different the.

	This makes no sense!!  What did you mean?? :-)

All over

> behaviour

	British spelling of behavior.

p.19, para.-1

> One problem with this approach is that it is easy to carried away

	perhaps "to get carried away"

p.19, para.1

> Perhaps Dog and Chien are two nodes

	Do you mean "chicken" or is Chien the name of some breed?



-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.1, para.-2

> that these nodes are organized in a taxonomic structure, and that
> binary relations joing those nodes.

	replace "those nodes" with "these nodes" or "the nodes"

p.7, para.-4

> Prolog inferences unsound, but actual errors happen very seldom,

	seldom is either an adverb (not often, infrequently) or
	an adjective (infrequent, rare).  The American Heritage
	Electronic Dictionary says the adjective form is "archaic."

p.13, para.1

> The SAM (...) program was the first, proving a lemma in lattice
> theory

	Was this a new lemma, a tough one to solve, or what?  I'd be
	interested in a little more detail (the history, as it were).

p.17, footnote

> Nixon was a Quaker (and hence a pacifist)

	Is this true?  I went to a Quaker school for 13 years and
	never heard that Nixon was a Quaker!  I'd check this out, 
	because they were pretty proud of all the historical Quakers,
	and they would have mentioned that (unless Nixon is not
	someone to be proud of ;-).
