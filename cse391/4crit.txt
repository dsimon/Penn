--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.1, byline:

> Search More Directly to the Goal.

	Should probably be something like 'toward' instead of 'to'

p.4, para.4

> The behaviour of A* search 

	British spelling of behaviour (I looked it up in noah)

p.4, para.-2

> is straightforwrd to

	You mean "is straight forward to"

p.5, para.1

> more narrowly focussed around

	focussed is the less common spelling of focused

p.5, para.-1

> it must eventually expand reach a goal state

	perhaps you meant "expand to reach a goal state" or just
	"reach a goal state"

p.6, para.-2

> will occur uness the

	"unless"

p.8, para.4

> node in question. because the

	I don't know what you mean here!

p.8, para.-4

> say exactly whatthe contribution

	put a space between "what" and "the"

p.9, para.3

> three times alongany

	put a space between "along" and "any"


-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.5, para.-3

> (there must be some such node, unless the path has been completely
> expanded in which case the algorithm would have returned G)

	Run on sentence.  The "in which case" should be made into
	another sentence or worded differently (notes in parentheses 
	do not have to be single sentences.  Take this one, for 
	instance :-)

p.6, para.2

	I like the Zeno's paradox stuff, but you may wish to explain
	why from W to S, h should have been 3 (I understand, but many
	won't).
	
p.9, para.-3

> The unresolved question is whether SMA* is optimally efficient among
> all algorithms given the same heuristic information and the same
> memory allocation.

   	Call me dumb, but I'm confused as what the question is
	actually about.  I guess optimally efficient doesn't explain 
	enough here for me.

p.12, para.-2

> but in most problems the operators are not predictable, as discussed

	Should be "the effects of the operators are not"...
