Chapter 8
Student: Derron Simon



--------------------- TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, ETC. ------------------------

p.8, para.4

> estimating labour costs

	British spelling of labor.

-------------- VISUAL LAYOUT, STYLE OF PARTICULAR PHRASES, ETC. --------------

p.1, para.2

> and writes down a formal description

	How about just "writes a formal description"?

p.1, para.2

> we will use examples that should already be fairly familiar

	How about "we will use examples that would already be familiar
	to a computer engineer" or something along those lines.  It 
	seems a little presumptuous to assume everyone knows TTL design.

p.1, para.-3

> build on these properties of the language it is written in

	Awkward.
 
p.7, para-3

	You mention Wumpus World, you might want to reference the
	reader to chapter 6.

p.8, para.1

> taxonomy to help the agent predict behaviour from scanty clues.

	"scanty clues" is quite an unusual phrase, it seems to carry 
	an odd connotation.

p.8, para.6

> for fruits or monetary instruments

	just being nit-picky, but I'd use monetary units... :>

p.12, para.3

> Generally speaking, instead of saying, as we did in situation
> calculus, that a given fact is true in a particular situation, we
> we'll say that a given event occured in a particular interval.

	Awkward sentence (and as you can see from the above
	formatting, many repeated words!)

p.16, para.2

> For our purposes a fluent is something that flows or changes across
> situations.  

	You may want more of a definition here.

------------------------------- FIGURES --------------------------------------

p.2 - Knowledge Engineering vs. Programming

	The analogy between "implementing the proof theory" and
	"choosing or writing a compiler" is a little weak.
